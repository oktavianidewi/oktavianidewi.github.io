Hi there, 

I am an Indonesian living in Surabaya. Currently working as Data Engineer in a startup company named GudangAda.

This is my very first blog about technical things. Previously I wrote mostly daily life posts on a wordpress blog, till I decided to create another blog to manage my rumbling thoughts when experiencing any technical stuffs. I think the goal of this blog will be my personal archives.

The topics may be various, but mainly about Leetcode, Golang, and any Data Engineering tutorials.

I will write the post either in Bahasa or English, because I need to improve my English communication skills. So if you encounter any grammar mistakes, please feel free to send me feedback, Iâ€™d be happy to hear.

When I am away from computer, I hangout with my family and teach coding to my daughter. I like to watch a heartwarming Japanese Dramas as well, please drop me your dorama recommendation :)
